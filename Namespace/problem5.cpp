//Using Standard Library Namespace
// In this example, we demonstrate the use of a standard library namespace.
// The std:: namespace contains many standard C++ functions and objects.
// In the main function, we use the std::cout and std::endl without needing to explicitly prefix them with std::.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Accessing standard library functions without prefix
    std::cout << "Hello, C++!" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
